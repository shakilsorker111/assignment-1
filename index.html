                <p>Bangladesh is finally free from the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina after 15 long years of oppression. Many have expressed that we have attained independence for ourselves for the second time. While this is indeed a moment to celebrate, it is also a critical juncture for the nation. Currently, there is no government (elected or otherwise), and chaos reigns, evidenced by vandalism, arson, and attacks on minority communities while the police forces called for a strike in protest against attacks by enraged citizens. The nation urgently needs to restore law and order, while the interim government formation is underway.</p>
